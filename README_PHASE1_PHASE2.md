## 🚨 Critical Notes

### ⚠️ Before You Do Anything
1. Read `ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` completely
2. Understand the manual setup requires Supabase Dashboard access
3. Know that manual setup takes ~5 minutes

### ⚠️ During Manual Setup
1. Follow the exact steps in `ACTION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Don't skip any steps
3. Verify each step completed before moving to next

### ⚠️ During Testing
1. Open browser console (F12) to watch for errors
2. Don't use mock data for feature testing - test with real DB
3. Report any errors you see with full error message

### ⚠️ About the Current State
- ❌ NOT production-ready (demo mode only)
- ✅ Fully functional for testing
- ✅ All core features working
- ⏳ Security features needed later

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep DevTools Open** — Press F12 while testing to see any errors
2. **Use the Debug Panel** — Settings → Monitoring → Debug Panel to check system health
3. **Test with Demo Users** — Use the 6 provided demo accounts
4. **Check Documentation First** — Most answers are in these docs
5. **Try Both Paths** — Create client, send message, create team member to verify everything

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know the setup was successful when:
- ✅ Debug Panel shows "Connection Status: ✅"
- ✅ All table row counts > 0
- ✅ You can send a message instantly (not after refresh)
- ✅ No red error messages in console
- ✅ Create client/team member works without errors

---

## 📝 Next Steps After Testing

1. **If tests pass:** Proceed to Phase 3 development
2. **If tests fail:** 
   - Check troubleshooting section in `ACTION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Review error messages in console
   - Verify manual setup completed correctly
